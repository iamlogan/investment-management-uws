# Investment Management App

This is the codebase for my Hons Project web application. The app is deployed to Heroku at [investment-management-uws.herokuapp.com](investment-management-uws.herokuapp.com).

## Features

The app is a work in progress, but current features include:

- User authentication, including email validation
- Create portfolios
- Register Investment Accounts (currently limited to FreeTrade and Trading 212)
- Register cash deposit and withdrawal events
- Register security purchase and sale events
- View latest prices for securities, updated every 10 minutes

## Limitations

*Update 18/02/2022: mandatory email validation has been temporarily suspended. Anyone can now register an account and sign in without validating their email address.*

This app that depends on a free, but limited, email server. Consequently, verification and password reset emails can only be sent to already whitelisted email addresses.

If you require your email to be whitelisted, don't hesitate to contact me at [b00289028@studentmail.uws.ac.uk](mailto:b00289028@studentmail.uws.ac.uk).
